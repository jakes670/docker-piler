2 issues with pilerpurge

Issue 1. cant find queue dir

https://bitbucket.org/jsuto/piler/issues/880/pilerpurge-not-working

had to add 

queuedir=/var/piler/store

to /etc/piler/piler.conf in docker image

Issue 2. used pilepurge patch to adress "pilerpurge.py doesn't use remote sql server"

Used pilerpurg.py from patch https://bitbucket.org/jsuto/piler/src/704030b2826e6c94a6dcd3bca7dcc3984083b625/util/pilerpurge.py


I updated the docker-complose file not the most effective way but I am new to dockerbuild
